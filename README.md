# Capstone Project 

Overview: 
The goal of this app was to showcase my ability to build a full-stack application with my own custom node.js backend API and React frontend. The application is a photo gallery application which mirrors the eary version of instagram which only feature photographs. 

Features and Functionality: 
Main features of the application are to allow users to share photos with one another and interact with each other as well. The users will have to ability to: 

-comment on other users uploaded photos 
-follow other users accounts 
-optionality to upload or remove photos and comments 

User Flow: 
-Users will initially be asked to signed up or login to an existing account 
-Once logged in, the user will be guided to a greeting page. 
-Posts on the main feed will display the username, caption and image. 


Custom API: 
The API used for this application was created and designed by me. The API consists of standard CRUD functions and follows RESTful architecural guidelines.

API Overview: 
To see how the API works, please refer to my Backend repository to explore my models, routes, and schema. I've included extensive comments throughout my code to help viewers understand and have a clearer image of my thought process.

To see how the frontend links to and communicates with my backend API, refer to the API file in my frontend repository.
